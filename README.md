# Object Tracking Data Set v1
The data set contains depth-images at a resolution of 640x480 at 30Hz and a groundtruth poses obtained from a VICON system at 100Hz. The data is based on OpenNI 1.5.x.

The current version can found be at https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/cassinaj/object_tracking_dataset_v1_lfs. To fetch the data set you need to use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com). 

The below figure shows an image of each object in the data set.

## Planned Updates
### Object Tracking Data Set v1.1
The data set will be converted to OpenNI 2.0 format. 

### Object Tracking Data Set v2
Recording data set containing depth and RGB images.
